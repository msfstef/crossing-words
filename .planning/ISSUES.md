### ISS-001: Configurable navigation behavior at word boundaries

- **Discovered:** Phase 02 Task 4 checkpoint (2026-01-11)
- **Resolved:** Phase 02 Task 4 checkpoint (2026-01-11)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** When typing at the end of a word, the cursor currently stays in place. Users may want options like: move to next word, wrap to start of current word, or move to next row. Making this configurable would improve UX for different solving styles.
- **Resolution:** Implemented default wrap behavior - at end of row moves to next row, at end of column moves to next column. Configuration deferred to Phase 8 if needed.
