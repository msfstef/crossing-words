# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Crossing Words is a cross-platform, peer-to-peer multiplayer crossword application where users can solve crosswords together simultaneously and collaboratively.

## Build & Development Commands

Always try to evaluate your work using the Playwright MCP or Chrome extension for end-to-end testing the web app before asking the human partner for a review.

<!-- TODO: Add build, test, and lint commands once the project structure is established -->

## Architecture

<!-- TODO: Document high-level architecture once implemented -->
