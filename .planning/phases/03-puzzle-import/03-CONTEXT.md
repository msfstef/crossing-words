# Phase 3: Puzzle Import - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Simple and invisible. Users shouldn't have to think about file formats — they just open a puzzle file from their device and it loads. A file picker to select .puz, .ipuz, or .jpz files, and the app handles the rest automatically.

The experience should feel instant and seamless. Pick a file, puzzle appears, start solving.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Format coverage** - Support all three formats (.puz, .ipuz, .jpz) reliably
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback when a file can't be loaded
- **Speed** - Instant loading, no waiting

All three matter equally. Import should just work.

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Saving/exporting puzzles - import only for this phase
- Puzzle creation/editing - load existing puzzles, don't build new ones
- Cloud/URL import - local files only (not explicitly excluded but not prioritized)

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements - open to standard approaches. The key is that it feels invisible to the user.
