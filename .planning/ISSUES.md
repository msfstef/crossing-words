# Project Issues Log

Enhancements discovered during execution. Not critical - address in future phases.

## Open Enhancements

### ISS-001: Configurable navigation behavior at word boundaries

- **Discovered:** Phase 02 Task 4 checkpoint (2026-01-11)
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** When typing at the end of a word, the cursor currently stays in place. Users may want options like: move to next word, wrap to start of current word, or move to next row. Making this configurable would improve UX for different solving styles.
- **Impact:** Low (works correctly, this would enhance)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Suggested phase:** Phase 8 (Polish & PWA)
