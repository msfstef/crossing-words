# Deploy to GitHub Pages using gh-pages branch
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow requires GitHub Pages to be configured to deploy from
# the gh-pages branch. Go to Settings > Pages > Source and select:
#   - Deploy from a branch
#   - Branch: gh-pages / (root)
#
# This approach is used instead of GitHub Actions artifacts to support PR preview
# deployments in subdirectories while preserving the main site.
